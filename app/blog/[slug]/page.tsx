        <li>Use proper heading structure (H1, H2, H3)</li>

      <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the structure and content of web pages. If you're new to web development, HTML is the perfect place to start.</p>
      
      <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
      <p>HTML is not a programming language; it's a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the content you want to display. HTML consists of a series of elements or tags that you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear or act in a certain way.</p>
      
      <div class="my-8">
        <img src="/images/blog/html-structure-example.png" alt="HTML Document Structure Example" class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg" />
        <p class="image-caption">Every HTML document follows a basic structure with head and body sections</p>
      </div>
      
      <h2>Basic Structure of an HTML Document</h2>
      <p>Every HTML document follows a basic structure:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;My First Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
      
      <h2>Common HTML Elements</h2>
      <p>Here are some common HTML elements you'll use frequently:</p>
      
      <h3>Headings</h3>
      <p>HTML provides six levels of headings, from &lt;h1&gt; (most important) to &lt;h6&gt; (least important).</p>
      
      <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
      <p>The &lt;p&gt; element defines a paragraph of text.</p>
      
      <h3>Links</h3>
      <p>The &lt;a&gt; (anchor) element creates a hyperlink to another page or resource.</p>
      
      <div class="my-8">

        <li>Open the file in a web browser</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>Congratulations! You've created your first HTML page. As you continue learning, you'll discover more HTML elements and attributes that allow you to create more complex and interactive web pages.</p>
      
      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <p>Once you're comfortable with HTML, the next steps in your web development journey would be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Learning CSS to style your HTML pages</li>
        <li>Learning JavaScript to add interactivity</li>
        <li>Exploring frameworks and libraries that make web development easier</li>
      </ul>

    content: `
      <p>CSS Flexbox has revolutionized how we create layouts on the web. If you've been struggling with floats and positioning, Flexbox offers a more intuitive way to design complex layout structures. In this guide, I'll break down Flexbox concepts with visual examples.</p>
      
      <h2>What is Flexbox?</h2>
      <p>Flexbox, or the Flexible Box Module, is a one-dimensional layout method designed for arranging items in rows or columns. It makes it easier to design flexible responsive layouts without using floats or positioning.</p>
      
      <div class="my-8">
        <img src="/images/blog/flexbox-container-items.png" alt="Flexbox Container and Items Visualization" class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg" />
        <p class="image-caption">Flexbox consists of a flex container (parent) and flex items (children)</p>
      </div>
      
      <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
      <p>To understand Flexbox, you need to grasp two fundamental concepts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Flex Container</strong>: The parent element that has <code>display: flex</code> applied to it</li>
        <li><strong>Flex Items</strong>: The direct children of the flex container</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Flex Container Properties</h2>
      
      <h3>flex-direction</h3>
      <p>This property establishes the main axis, defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container.</p>
      
      <div class="my-8">
        <img src="/images/blog/flex-direction-examples.png" alt="Flex Direction Property Examples" class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg" />
        <p class="image-caption">Flex-direction controls the direction of flex items</p>
      </div>
      
      <h3>justify-content</h3>
      <p>This defines the alignment along the main axis, helping distribute extra free space.</p>
      
      <h3>align-items</h3>
      <p>This defines how flex items are laid out along the cross axis (perpendicular to the main axis).</p>
      
      <h2>Practical Example</h2>
      <p>Let's create a simple navigation bar with Flexbox:</p>
      <pre><code>.navbar {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 1rem 2rem;
  background-color: #333;
  color: white;
}</code></pre>
      
      <div class="my-8">
        <img src="/images/blog/flexbox-navigation-example.png" alt="Flexbox Navigation Bar Example" class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg" />
        <p class="image-caption">Flexbox makes creating navigation bars simple and intuitive</p>
      </div>
      
      <h2>Responsive Layouts with Flexbox</h2>
      <p>Flexbox really shines when creating responsive layouts. Here's a simple example of a layout that changes from row to column on smaller screens.</p>
      
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Flexbox has transformed how we approach layout design on the web. It provides a more efficient way to lay out, align, and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic.</p>
      
      <p>As you continue your CSS journey, I recommend experimenting with different Flexbox properties to get a feel for how they work together. The more you practice, the more intuitive it will become!</p>

    content: `
      <p>JavaScript arrays come with powerful built-in methods that can make your code cleaner, more readable, and more efficient. In this article, I'll cover 10 essential array methods that every JavaScript developer should know.</p>
      
      <div class="my-8">
        <img src="/images/blog/javascript-arrays-overview.png" alt="JavaScript Array Methods Overview" class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg" />
        <p class="image-caption">JavaScript arrays provide powerful built-in methods for data manipulation</p>
      </div>
      
      <h2>1. map()</h2>
      <p>The <code>map()</code> method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.</p>
      <pre><code>const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]</code></pre>
      
      <h2>2. filter()</h2>
      <p>The <code>filter()</code> method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.</p>
      <pre><code>const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
console.log(evenNumbers); // [2, 4]</code></pre>
      
      <h2>3. reduce()</h2>
      <p>The <code>reduce()</code> method executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.</p>
      
      <div class="my-8">
        <img src="/images/blog/array-methods-examples.png" alt="JavaScript Array Methods Code Examples" class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg" />
        <p class="image-caption">Array methods like map, filter, and reduce are essential for functional programming</p>
      </div>
      
      <h2>4. forEach()</h2>
      <p>The <code>forEach()</code> method executes a provided function once for each array element.</p>
      
      <h2>5. find()</h2>
      <p>The <code>find()</code> method returns the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function.</p>
      
      <h2>Bonus: Chaining Methods</h2>
      <p>One of the powerful features of these array methods is that many of them can be chained together for more complex operations:</p>
      <pre><code>const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

const result = numbers
  .filter(num => num % 2 === 0) // Get even numbers
  .map(num => num * 2) // Double each number
  .reduce((total, current) => total + current, 0); // Sum them up

console.log(result); // 60</code></pre>
      
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>These array methods are essential tools in a JavaScript developer's toolkit. They allow you to write more declarative, readable code by abstracting away the implementation details of common operations.</p>
      
      <p>By mastering these methods, you'll be able to manipulate arrays more efficiently and write cleaner code. Remember that most of these methods create new arrays rather than modifying the original, which helps maintain immutability in your applications.</p>

    content: `
      <p>Git is an essential tool for modern software development. Whether you're working solo or as part of a team, understanding Git will help you track changes, collaborate effectively, and maintain a history of your project. This guide will walk you through a basic Git workflow from start to finish.</p>
      
      <h2>What is Git?</h2>
      <p>Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes in your code. It allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.</p>
      
      <div class="my-8">
        <img src="/images/blog/git-version-control.png" alt="Git Version Control System Overview" class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg" />
        <p class="image-caption">Git helps track changes and manage different versions of your code</p>
      </div>
      
      <h2>Basic Git Workflow</h2>
      
      <h3>Step 1: Initialize a Repository</h3>
      <p>To start tracking a project with Git, navigate to your project folder in the terminal and initialize a Git repository:</p>
      <pre><code>cd my-project
git init</code></pre>
      
      <h3>Step 2: Add Files to the Staging Area</h3>
      <p>Git uses a staging area (or index) to track changes you want to commit.</p>
      
      <div class="my-8">
        <img src="/images/blog/git-staging-area.png" alt="Git Staging Area Concept" class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg" />
        <p class="image-caption">The staging area allows you to prepare changes before committing them</p>
      </div>
      
      <h3>Step 3: Commit Changes</h3>
      <p>Once you've added files to the staging area, you can commit them to the repository with a message describing the changes:</p>
      <pre><code>git commit -m "Add initial files"</code></pre>
      
      <h2>Working with Remote Repositories</h2>
      <p>To collaborate with others, you'll need to work with remote repositories (like those hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).</p>
      
      <h3>Step 6: Connect to a Remote Repository</h3>
      <p>If you've created a repository on GitHub, you can connect your local repository to it:</p>
      <pre><code>git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git</code></pre>
      
      <div class="my-8">
        <img src="/images/blog/git-remote-repository.png" alt="Git Remote Repository Connection" class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg" />
        <p class="image-caption">Remote repositories enable collaboration and backup of your code</p>
      </div>
      
      <h2>Branching Workflow</h2>
      <p>Branches allow you to work on features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.</p>
      
      <h2>Best Practices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Commit Often</strong>: Make small, focused commits that address a single issue or feature</li>
        <li><strong>Write Clear Commit Messages</strong>: Use descriptive messages that explain what changes were made and why</li>
        <li><strong>Pull Before Push</strong>: Always pull the latest changes before pushing to avoid conflicts</li>
        <li><strong>Use Branches</strong>: Create branches for new features or bug fixes to keep the main branch stable</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>This basic Git workflow will help you get started with version control. As you become more comfortable with Git, you can explore more advanced features like rebasing, cherry-picking, and using Git hooks.</p>
      
      <p>Remember, Git has a learning curve, but the investment in learning it pays off tremendously in your development workflow. Don't be afraid to make mistakes—Git is designed to help you recover from them!</p>
